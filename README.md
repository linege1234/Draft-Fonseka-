# Draft-Fonseka-
The first draft of user's marvel hero soccer team.
Using the input or select, users can browse all the heroes in the table(Material ui).
And if clicking the row, can select sccer position such as striker, midfielder, defense, goalkeeper, or sub.
And users can locate the posion in the filed map using drag white one and drop(Framer motion).

However, It's the first draft of hero soccer team.
it hasn't functionality to send the data(marvel's name) to white one.
It needs redux to store the data of one component and transmit it to filed component

I uploaded the first draft of web applcation screenshot.
